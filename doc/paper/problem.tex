\section{Problem Formulation}
\label{sec:problem-formulation}

Concentrate single-mindedly on a narrative that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Describes the problem, and why it is interesting
\item Describes your idea
\item Defends your idea, showing how it solves the problem, and filling out the details.
\end{itemize}
On the way, cite relevant work in passing, but defer discussion to the end

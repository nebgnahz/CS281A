\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

To sum up, we have observed that measurements of different devices can help to distinguish different activities. As is mentioned above, this specialization comes from the fact that three devices are actually measuring the movement of different parts of human body. Therefore we propose that a combined sensoring system could greatly improve the classification performance of activity recognition. Major part of our future work will be devoted to this direction.

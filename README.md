# _Activity Recognition_

_Description: This is the repository for [CS281A Spring](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/281A-spring14/) at Berkeley._

## Overview
We focus on activity recognition problem on commercial mobile
platforms including Android phones, Google Glass and Pebble
Smartwatch. Because of their different positions on human body, their
performances would differ; and this project aims to investigate 1)
which device is better for which activity, 2) the quantitative
differnece. We describe the whole process of system implementation,
data collection, feature extraction and activity recognition, and
present our findings of the performance for each device.

## Result
